Warning Log Filter

This module provides a generator-based approach to filter and extract warning messages
from log files. It uses Python generators for memory-efficient processing of large log files.

Functions:
    warnings_filter: Generator function that yields filtered warning messages
    extract_and_parse_3: Extract warnings from log file and save to CSV
    main: Entry point for standalone execution

    Filter and reformat warning messages from a log file using generators.

    This generator function processes log lines one at a time, filtering for
    warning messages and parsing them into structured components. It's memory
    efficient for large log files.

    Args:
        source (Iterable[str]): Iterable of log lines (typically from a file)

    Yields:
        tuple[str, str, str]: Parsed log components (timestamp, level, message)
                             Only yields for lines containing "WARNING"

    Example:
        >>> with open('sample.log') as f:
        ...     for timestamp, level, message in warnings_filter(f):
        ...         print(f"{timestamp}: {message}")

    Note:
        Lines that don't match the expected log format are skipped silently.
        The function assumes log format: "MMM DD, YYYY HH:MM:SS LEVEL message"
