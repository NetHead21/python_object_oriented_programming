Advanced Generator Chain Log Parser

This module demonstrates advanced generator chaining techniques for processing log files.
It shows how to create a pipeline of generators that efficiently process data through
multiple transformation stages without loading everything into memory.

The generator chain:
0. possible_match_iter: Attempts to match each line against the log pattern
1. group_iter: Extracts groups from successful matches
2. warnings_filter: Filters for WARNING level messages only

Functions:
    extract_and_parse_g1: Extract warnings using chained generators
    main: Entry point for standalone execution
