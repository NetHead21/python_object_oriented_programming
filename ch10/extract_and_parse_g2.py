Advanced Generator Chain Log Parser

This module demonstrates advanced generator chaining techniques for processing log files.
It shows how to create a pipeline of generators that efficiently process data through
multiple transformation stages without loading everything into memory.

The generator chain:
0. possible_match_iter: Attempts to match each line against the log pattern
1. group_iter: Extracts groups from successful matches
2. warnings_filter: Filters for WARNING level messages only

Functions:
    extract_and_parse_g1: Extract warnings using chained generators
    main: Entry point for standalone execution

    Extract warning messages from a log file using chained generators.

    Demonstrates advanced generator chaining techniques where multiple generators
    are connected in a pipeline to process log data efficiently. Each generator
    in the chain performs a specific transformation on the data.

    Args:
        full_log_path (Path): Path to the input log file
        warning_log_path (Path): Path to the output CSV file

    Returns:
        int: Number of warning messages extracted

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the input log file doesn't exist
        PermissionError: If unable to write to output file
        UnicodeDecodeError: If log file contains invalid encoding

    Example:
        >>> count = extract_and_parse_g1(Path('app.log'), Path('warnings.csv'))
        >>> print(f"Extracted {count} warning messages using generator chains")

    Generator Chain Explanation:
        0. possible_match_iter: Tries to match each line with regex
        1. group_iter: Extracts matched groups from successful matches
        2. warnings_filter: Filters for WARNING level messages only

    This approach is memory efficient as it processes one line at a time
    without storing intermediate results.
