"""
operator.methodcaller Comprehensive Tutorial and Examples

This module demonstrates the powerful capabilities of Python's `operator.methodcaller` function,
which provides an efficient way to call methods on objects with predefined arguments and
keyword arguments.

Overview:
---------
The `methodcaller` function returns a callable object that calls the given method on its
operand. It's particularly useful for:
- Calling methods with fixed arguments on collections of objects
- Functional programming patterns where you need to pass method calls
- Performance-critical method calling scenarios
- Data transformation and processing pipelines
- Creating reusable method call patterns

Key Features:
------------
✨ Method calling with positional arguments
✨ Method calling with keyword arguments
✨ Method calling with mixed arguments
✨ Performance optimized for repeated method calls
✨ Clean, readable code for functional operations
✨ Seamless integration with built-in functions (map, filter, etc.)
✨ Type-safe method name validation

Performance Benefits:
--------------------
- Faster than lambda functions for simple method calls
- Memory efficient for large datasets
- Optimized C implementation in CPython
- Reduces function call overhead
- Pre-validates method names at creation time

Use Cases:
----------
1. **Batch Operations**: Apply same method to collection of objects
2. **Data Processing**: Transform collections using method calls
3. **Functional Programming**: Use with map(), filter(), sorted()
4. **API Operations**: Batch method calls on API objects
5. **String Processing**: Bulk string transformations
6. **Collection Management**: Batch operations on containers
