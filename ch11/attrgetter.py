Python operator.attrgetter - Comprehensive Examples and Usage Guide
==================================================================

This module demonstrates the powerful capabilities of Python's `operator.attrgetter`
function through practical examples and real-world use cases.

Overview
--------
The `attrgetter` function from the `operator` module is a utility that creates
callable objects for extracting attributes from other objects. It's particularly
useful for functional programming, data processing, and when you need to pass
attribute access as a function to other functions like `sorted()`, `map()`, or
`groupby()`.

Key Features Demonstrated:
-------------------------
1. **Basic Attribute Access**: Extract single attributes from objects
2. **Multiple Attributes**: Get multiple attributes as tuples
3. **Nested Attributes**: Access deeply nested attributes using dot notation
4. **Sorting and Grouping**: Use with sorting algorithms and grouping operations
5. **Performance**: Compare performance with direct access and lambda functions
6. **Error Handling**: Safely handle missing attributes
7. **Real-world Applications**: Log analysis, data processing, and more

Examples Included:
-----------------
- Basic usage with Person objects
- Multiple attribute extraction
- Nested attribute access (Employee.address.city)
- Sorting products by price and rating
- Grouping students by subject and grade
- Complex nested structures (Company/Department/Employee)
- Error handling for missing attributes
- Performance benchmarks vs direct access and lambdas
- Real-world log analysis example

When to Use attrgetter:
----------------------
‚úÖ Sorting by object attributes: `sorted(items, key=attrgetter('price'))`
‚úÖ Extracting data for processing: Converting objects to tuples/lists
‚úÖ Functional programming: Passing to `map()`, `filter()`, `groupby()`
‚úÖ Performance-critical attribute access
‚úÖ Clean syntax for nested attributes: `attrgetter('user.profile.name')`
‚úÖ Grouping operations with `itertools.groupby()`

Performance Notes:
-----------------
- `attrgetter` is typically faster than lambda functions for simple attribute access
- Particularly efficient when used repeatedly (e.g., in sorting large datasets)
- Creates reusable callable objects that can be stored and passed around

operator.attrgetter Comprehensive Tutorial and Examples

This module demonstrates the powerful capabilities of Python's `operator.attrgetter` function,
which provides an efficient and readable way to extract attributes from objects.

Overview:
---------
The `attrgetter` function returns a callable object that fetches the given attribute(s) 
from its operand. It's particularly useful for:
- Sorting collections of objects
- Data extraction and transformation
- Functional programming patterns
- Performance-critical attribute access
- Nested attribute navigation

Key Features:
------------
‚ú® Single and multiple attribute extraction
‚ú® Nested attribute access using dot notation
‚ú® Performance optimized for large datasets
‚ú® Clean, readable code for complex data operations
‚ú® Seamless integration with built-in functions (sorted, max, min, etc.)
‚ú® Error handling for missing attributes

Common Use Cases:
----------------
1. **Sorting**: Sort objects by one or more attributes
2. **Grouping**: Group objects by shared attributes
3. **Filtering**: Extract objects based on attribute values
4. **Data Processing**: Transform object collections to simple data types
5. **Analytics**: Aggregate and analyze object attributes

Performance Benefits:
--------------------
- Faster than lambda functions for simple attribute access
- Memory efficient for large datasets
- Optimized C implementation in CPython
- Reduces function call overhead

Examples Included:
-----------------
‚Ä¢ Basic single and multiple attribute access
‚Ä¢ Nested attribute navigation (obj.attr.subattr)
‚Ä¢ Sorting collections by attributes
‚Ä¢ Grouping and filtering operations
‚Ä¢ Complex nested data structures
‚Ä¢ Error handling and edge cases
‚Ä¢ Performance comparisons
‚Ä¢ Real-world data processing scenarios
