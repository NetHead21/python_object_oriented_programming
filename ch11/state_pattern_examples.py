State Design Pattern Examples

This module demonstrates the State design pattern through practical examples:
1. ATM Machine with different states and transitions
2. Document Workflow System
3. Media Player with state-dependent behaviors

The State pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal
state changes, eliminating complex conditional logic and making the code
more maintainable and extensible.
