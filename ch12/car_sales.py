Car Sales Data Analysis Module

This module provides functionality for analyzing car sales data using SQLite database
operations and CSV output generation. It demonstrates the Template Method design pattern
for database query processing and supports various types of sales analysis reports.

The module contains:
    - Database setup and initialization with sample data
    - QueryTemplate: Abstract base class implementing the Template Method pattern
    - NewVehiclesQuery: Query for filtering new vehicle sales
    - SalesGrossQuery: Query for calculating gross sales by salesperson
    - CSV output generation with flexible destination handling

Key Features:
    • Template Method pattern for consistent query processing workflow
    • SQLite database integration with automatic schema creation
    • Flexible output handling (stdout or file-based CSV generation)
    • Date-based filename generation for reports
    • Comprehensive sales data analysis capabilities

Example Usage:
    >>> # Set up database and run analysis
    >>> test_setup()
    >>>
    >>> # Generate new vehicles report to stdout
    >>> new_vehicles = NewVehiclesQuery()
    >>> new_vehicles.process_format()
    >>>
    >>> # Generate gross sales report to dated CSV file
    >>> gross_sales = SalesGrossQuery()
    >>> gross_sales.process_format()

Dependencies:
    - contextlib: For context manager operations
    - csv: For CSV file generation
    - pathlib: For file path operations
    - sqlite3: For database operations
    - typing: For type hints
    - sys: For stdout access
    - datetime: For date-based file naming
