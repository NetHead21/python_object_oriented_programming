Abstract Factory Pattern - Comprehensive Examples and Implementation Guide

This module provides extensive examples of the Abstract Factory design pattern,
demonstrating its application across multiple domains including GUI frameworks,
infrastructure components, and manufacturing systems.

PATTERN OVERVIEW:
================
The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an
interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
specifying their concrete classes. It's particularly useful when:

- Your system needs to work with multiple product families
- Products within a family must be compatible with each other
- You want to switch between different product families easily
- You need to ensure consistency across related objects

PATTERN STRUCTURE:
==================
- Abstract Factory: Interface declaring creation methods for abstract products
- Concrete Factory: Implements creation methods for specific product families
- Abstract Product: Interface for a type of product object
- Concrete Product: Specific implementations created by concrete factories
- Client: Uses only abstract factory and product interfaces

EXAMPLES INCLUDED:
==================
1. GUI Components: Cross-platform user interface elements
   - Windows, Mac, and Linux implementations
   - Button, Window, and Menu families
   - Demonstrates platform-specific styling and behavior

2. Infrastructure Components: Environment-specific system components
   - Production, Staging, and Development environments
   - Database, Cache, and Logger families
   - Shows environment-appropriate implementations

3. Vehicle Manufacturing: Different vehicle types and components
   - Luxury, Economy, and Electric vehicle families
   - Engine, Transmission, and Interior components
   - Illustrates manufacturing consistency within product lines

KEY BENEFITS DEMONSTRATED:
==========================
✅ Family Consistency: All products from one factory work together
✅ Easy Switching: Change entire product family with one line
✅ Extensibility: Add new families without changing existing code
✅ Testability: Mock factories enable comprehensive testing
✅ Platform Independence: Client code works across all implementations
✅ SOLID Principles: Follows Open/Closed and Dependency Inversion

USAGE PATTERNS:
===============
1. Factory Selection: Use enums or configuration to choose factories
2. Dependency Injection: Inject factories for flexibility and testing
3. Environment Detection: Automatically select appropriate factory
4. Plugin Architecture: Load factories dynamically for extensibility

Real-world analogies:
- Restaurant chains (McDonald's vs Burger King - different "factories"
  creating compatible families of food items)
- Car manufacturers (BMW vs Toyota - each creates families of compatible
  parts and components)
- Operating systems (Windows vs Mac vs Linux - each provides families
  of compatible UI components and system services)

    This class defines the common interface that all platform-specific buttons
    must implement. It's part of the Abstract Factory pattern where different
    GUI factories create platform-appropriate button implementations.

    The Button interface ensures all concrete buttons provide consistent
    functionality while allowing platform-specific visual styling and behavior.

    Examples:
        WindowsButton implements Windows-style button with system look
