Card Games Framework Module

This module provides a comprehensive framework for implementing various card games
using object-oriented design patterns. It demonstrates the Factory Method pattern,
Abstract Base Classes, and polymorphism to create a flexible system that can handle
multiple card game types with different rules and scoring systems.

The module contains:
    - Card: Basic card representation with rank and suit
    - Suit: Enumeration of card suits using Unicode symbols
    - Hand: Base class for collections of cards
    - CardGameFactory: Abstract factory for creating game-specific cards and hands
    - Cribbage implementation: Complete scoring system for cribbage hands
    - Poker implementation: Complete scoring system for poker hands
    - Game: Base game controller with deck management

Key Features:
    • Factory Method pattern for game-specific card and hand creation
    • Polymorphic scoring systems for different game types
    • Comprehensive trick/hand recognition algorithms
    • Unicode suit symbols for visual card representation
    • Flexible hand evaluation with powerset analysis
    • Type-safe implementation with full type hints

Supported Games:
    - Cribbage: 15s, pairs, runs, right jack scoring
    - Poker: Standard poker hand rankings and evaluation

Recent Fixes Applied:
    ✅ Fixed CribbageCard.po9ints → points
    ✅ Fixed CribbageAce.point → points
    ✅ Fixed CribbageTrick.Fiftleen → Fifteen
    ✅ Added missing CribbageTrick.Right_Jack
    ✅ Fixed CribbageFactory face card creation
    ✅ Fixed Game.dect → deck attribute naming
    ✅ All code now runs without errors

Example Usage:
    >>> # Create a cribbage game
    >>> factory = CribbageFactory()
    >>> cards = [factory.make_card(6, Suit.Clubs), factory.make_card(9, Suit.Hearts)]
    >>> hand = factory.make_hand(*cards)
    >>> starter = factory.make_card(5, Suit.Spades)
    >>> score = hand.upcard(starter).scoring()
    >>>
    >>> # Create a poker game
    >>> poker_factory = PokerFactory()
    >>> poker_hand = poker_factory.make_hand(*poker_cards)
    >>> ranking = poker_hand.scoring()

Dependencies:
    - abc: Abstract base classes
    - collections: Counter for frequency analysis
    - random: Deck shuffling
    - enum: Enumeration support
    - typing: Type hints and protocols
    - itertools: Combination and permutation utilities

    Enumeration of card suits using Unicode symbols.

    This enumeration provides a type-safe way to represent card suits
    with visual Unicode symbols. It inherits from both str and Enum,
    allowing suits to be used as strings while maintaining type safety.

    Attributes:
        Clubs: Black club suit symbol ♣

        Hearts: Black heart suit symbol ♥
