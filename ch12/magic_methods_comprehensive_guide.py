Python Magic Methods (Dunder Methods) - Comprehensive Guide

This module demonstrates the most important and commonly used magic methods in Python.
Magic methods (also called dunder methods for "double underscore") allow you to define
how objects of your class behave with built-in Python operations and functions.

Key Categories:
    1. Object Creation & Destruction
    2. String Representation
    3. Arithmetic Operations
    4. Comparison Operations
    5. Container/Sequence Operations
    6. Attribute Access
    7. Callable Objects
    8. Context Managers
    9. Iteration Protocol
    10. Copying and Pickling

Real-world Applications:
    - Custom data structures (vectors, matrices, linked lists)
    - Database ORM models with custom behavior
    - Configuration objects with attribute access
    - Mathematical objects with operator overloading
    - File-like objects with context management
    - Custom collections with iteration support
